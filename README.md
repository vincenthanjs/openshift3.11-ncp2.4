# openshift3.11-ncp2.4

The last few blog posts I wrote about the installation steps for Openshift Container Platform (OCP) with NSX-T NCP attracted some good interest from the community as well as VMware internal folks. However, those materials were written quite awhile back and some of software used then were not up to date. My customers were also looking at the later versions of software. Lastly, in OCP 3.11, the ansible playbooks for NSX-T NCP integration comes out of the box and therefore makes the integration much simpler. Therefore, gave the reason to write this blog post.

The high level steps remains unchanged. However, the part 5 in this case has been streamline into the Openshift installation.
